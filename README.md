## 🏢 Project Overview
This collaborative class proposes “Blackhawk Alerting”, a mobile and web alerting system for Southeastern Community College. The app improves campus communications by delivering Weather, Emergency, and Information event alerts via push notifications.

The project includes a full systems analysis: problem definition, use cases, and UML diagrams. The work was presented at SCC’s “One Good Thing” showcase, where I received a certificate of recognition for my presentation.

## 🎯 Objectives
* Replace SMS alerts with a centralized mobile & web app for push notifications.  
* Support multiple alert types: Weather, Emergency, and Information events.  
* Provide admin tools for creating, approving, and managing alerts.  
* Allow offline access to recent alerts (inbox/history).  
* Offer subscription options for non-mandatory informational alerts.  
* Improve accessibility for international students and users without cellular service.
